<h2 class="head2">Hoenn Region (Generation 3)</h2>
<article>
<p2>After hearing about a distant region called Hoenn from Harrison, the opponent he lost to in the Silver Conference, Ash decided to journey there and take only Pikachu with him this time. 
In Hoenn, Ash met a girl named May and her younger brother Max, who has an extensive, impressive knowledge of Pokémon that far exceeds his years. 
He later learned were Petalburg Gym Leader Norman's children, and both of whom decided to join Ash on his travels. 
Shortly after the three companions left Petalburg City, Brock rejoined the group when he saved them from a flock of angry Taillow and their leader. 
From that point onward, Ash journeyed through Hoenn with one old friend and two new friends, collecting Gym Badges in much the same fashion as before. </p2> <br>

<p2>Once May set her sights on becoming a Top Coordinator, Ash supported her whenever he could while maintaining his focus on winning Badges. 
Ash encountered both Team Magma and Team Aqua, two villainous crime syndicates occupying the Hoenn region for the first time. 
Ash won his first three badges by the end of this subtitle portion of the sixth season: the Stone Badge from Roxanne of the Rustboro Gym, the Knuckle Badge from a rematch with Brawly from the Dewford Gym, and the Dynamo Badge from Wattson of the Mauville Gym. 
He also caught three Pokémon: Taillow, Treecko and Corphish.

While Ash had no major recurring rival in Hoenn, he did encounter certain Trainers multiple times and formed friendly rivalries with them. 
One such friend was Morrison, who was very similar to and just as competitive as Ash and was first introduced close to the end of the group's travels in Hoenn. </p2> <br>

<p2>Ash was eager to challenge more Gyms as he was able to win the Heat Badge from Flannery, the Balance Badge from Norman, May and Max's father, and a Feather Badge from Winona. Ash's Pokémon team changed a bit. 
He caught a Torkoal while his Treecko and Taillow evolves into Grovyle and Swellow. </p2> <br>

<p2>Before winning his last few badges, Ash was caught in a clash between Teams Magma and Aqua as they unleashed the Legendary Pokémon Groudon and Kyogre to reshape the world. 
Due to Pikachu's connection with Groudon since absorbed the Blue Orb, both teams were stopped and the legendary Pokémon returned to rest. 
After that, Ash beat the twin Gym Leaders Tate and Liza for the Mind Badge and Grand Festival winner Juan for the Rain Badge. </p2> <br>

<p2> Prior to entering the Hoenn League, Ash declined an offer from Professor Oak to trade in his current Pokémon with his previous captures on the grounds that his new team had earned it for themselves. 
He gained two new rivals in Morrison and Tyson, the former he would beat, but the latter he would lose to. 
He caught a Snorunt, which later evolves into Glalie. 
<figure>

</figure>
He placed among the Top 8. Just like the Indigo Plateau and Silver Conferences, Ash did not win the Ever Grande Conference, but he came very close before losing to Tyson, who went on to win the tournament. 
After parting ways with May, Max, and Brock, Ash returned to Pallet Town. </p2> <br>

<p2> As he passed through Viridian City on his way back home, he met Scott and Agatha and learned about the Battle Frontier in Kanto. <br>
Returning to home alone followed by leaving Torkoal & Glalie at Professor Oak's laboratory & bringing Phanpy on the team once, Ash was invited to partake in the Battle Frontier, battling Frontier Brains for Frontier Symbols. <br>
He decided to take on the Battle Frontier and was surprised but happy to learn that Brock, May, and Max would join him on this adventure as well. <br>
Upon encountering the first Frontier Brain, Factory Head Noland and his Articuno, Ash left his friends for a quick bit while the Factory Head took Max and Pikachu up in his airplane, telling them "I had to make a phone call." Later that night, as the gang was watching Noland's Pokémon eat dinner, they speculated which of Noland's Pokémon Ash would challenge: Max guessed Venusaur, May guessed Rhyhorn, but Ash, aiming high, boldly decided on Articuno, the Legendary Bird of Ice. 
Wondering which of Ash's Pokémon he would use against a Legendary, the gang was excited when they saw his pick; Ash had gone straight to the top and brought in the big guns, calling in Charizard from the Charicific Valley to take on the Ice/Flying-type head-to-head. 
Despite the Type advantage being set against it, Noland's Articuno demonstrated its ability to quickly recover after taking direct hits from Charizard's Flamethrower and DragonBreath attacks and managed to gain an advantage over the fiery behemoth with an Ice Beam to the wingtip and repeatedly combining its Ice Beam and Water Pulse attacks, the latter move being strong enough to counter Charizard's newest move: Overheat. 
Ultimately though, Charizard managed to withstand Articuno's Steel Wing attack, and as the Legendary Bird came in for one last strike, it grabbed its wings in midair, stopping the attack before it could connect and topped it off with its signature Seismic Toss, knocking out Articuno for the win and earning Ash the Knowledge Symbol. <br>
Ash battled all of the remaining Frontier Brains, Arena Tycoon Greta, Dome Ace Tucker, Pike Queen Lucy, Palace Maven Spenser <br>
and Salon Maiden Anabel (after losing to her once), and earned their Frontier Symbols. <br>
The last Frontier Brain however, Pyramid King Brandon, proved to be more difficult for Ash to defeat; Their first official battle saw Brandon's Registeel defeating Ash's Torkoal in spite of a new move it learned. <br>
For their rematch, which would be four-on-four, Ash took a "back to your roots" approach, once again calling in Charizard but also this time bringing in Bulbasaur and Squirtle to reunite his trio of Kanto Starters. 
Putting them together with Pikachu, Ash formed a team of aces from his early days: pitting the four aces against Brandon's Dusclops, Ninjask, Solrock and Regice, he finally claimed victory and the final Frontier Symbol - the Brave Symbol - completing the set and winning the Battle Frontier. 
After his victory, Scott offered Ash the position of Frontier Brain when one of them retired but he declined, opting instead to continue his journey. </p2> <br>

<p2> Before saying goodbye to May, Ash competed against her in the Terratta Pokémon Contest, their match ending in a tie. 
There was only one ribbon and they couldn't decide who to give it to. 
Ash had his Sceptile use Leaf Blade to cut the ribbon in half, choosing to split it with May before they all parted ways. 
Returning home, Ash met up with Gary again and saw the latter's new Electivire. 
Gary informed Ash about the region of Sinnoh, to which he immediately decided to travel next on his journey. 
He manages to catch an Aipom, who joins him on his Sinnoh journey. </p2>
