<h2 class="head2">Alola Region (Generation 7)</h2>
<article>
<p2> Ash traveled with Delia to the Alola region after Mimey won the trip via lottery. It was shown that Ash gave his Kalos Pokémon to Professor Oak, who gave him and his mother a Pokémon Egg to deliver to his cousin Samson. 
While on Melemele Island, Ash stumbled upon the Pokémon School, where he met Lana, Lillie, Mallow, Kiawe, Sophocles, Samson, and Professor Kukui and learned about Z-Rings and Z-Moves. 
Later on, he met Tapu Koko, the guardian of Melemele Island, who gave Ash a Z-Ring and an Electrium Z. <p2> <br>

<p2> With these discoveries, Ash decided to remain in Alola to study at the school and learn more about Z-Moves, living with Professor Kukui.
Later, Tapu Koko challenged Ash and Pikachu to a battle. Ash's Electrium Z broke after Ash and Pikachu used the Z-Move Gigavolt Havoc on Tapu Koko. </p2> <br>
<p2> Ash then decided to take on the island challenge to obtain new Z-Crystals and prove his worth. <br>
Ash caught several Pokémon on Melemele Island, such as his Rowlet, Rockruff, and Litten. 
Ash also got a Normalium Z after his fight with Totem Gumshoos on Melemele Island. 
Tapu Koko gave him a new Electrium Z after Ash won his grand trial battle with Melemele Island Kahuna Hala. Also, Ash struck up a friendly rivalry with Lillie's brother Gladion. <br>
He then gained a Grassium Z and Rockium Z during his trial and grand trial on Akala Island. 
He also briefly reunited with Brock, Misty, and some of his Pokémon during a field trip to Kanto for an extracurricular activity. <br>
One day, Ash was entrusted to take care of a Cosmog by Solgaleo and Lunala, which he saw in a dream. The Cosmog, nicknamed Nebby by Lillie, took a liking to Ash and frequently caused trouble with its ability to teleport people around. 
In Faba's Revenge!, Faba kidnapped Nebby while Ash's attention was elsewhere. When Ash and Lillie learned about this, they enlisted Gladion and Lusamine in helping them rescue it. <br>
When the four found Faba, they also found that he successfully forced Nebby to summon a Nihilego from an Ultra Wormhole. After Nihilego kidnapped Lusamine and retreated into the Ultra Wormhole, Ash discovered that the incident caused Nebby to evolve into a Cosmoem.
Ash, his classmates, and Gladion then watched as the guardian deities helped Nebby evolve into the Legendary Pokémon Solgaleo and upgrade Ash's Z-Ring into a Z-Power Ring. </p2> <br>

</figure>
<p2> With a Solganium Z he received from Nebby, Ash activated Solgaleo's Z-Move, Searing Sunraze Smash, and had Nebby opened up an Ultra Wormhole, allowing everyone to traverse through Ultra Space on Nebby's back. </p2> <br>
<p2> There, after Ash's Electrium Z temporarily transformed into a Pikashunium Z, Ash and Pikachu used it to launch a 10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt. The attack defeated Nihilego, weakening it long enough for Lillie and Gladion to pull their mother free from its hold. <br>
The Pikashunium Z then reverted to an Electrium Z. With their mission finished, Lusamine was taken back through the Ultra Wormhole to the Altar of the Sunne. </p2> <br>

<p2> During Kukui and Burnet's wedding reception in the aftermath of the incident, Ash and his friends were invited to join an Ultra Beast response task force, known as the Ultra Guardians, which they all agreed to. <br>

On their first mission, Ash and his classmates were assigned to capture a Buzzwole that had appeared through an Ultra Wormhole. 
The Ultra Guardians encountered it at Mahalo Trail, where Ash eventually realized it preferred flexing to battling. 
As a result, Ash and Kiawe distracted it long enough for the former to throw a Beast Ball at it, successfully capturing it. Later, Buzzwole was brought to Melemele Meadow, where Professor Burnet temporarily opened a new wormhole, allowing Buzzwole to return home.
Later, Ash encountered a Poipole who seemed strangely attached to Pikachu. After a while, Poipole was confirmed to be an Ultra Beast. 
Ash was permitted to capture it, though he failed several times as Poipole thought the catching process was a game. After Ash helped it understand what was happening, Poipole allowed itself to be captured and was allowed to stay with the group until they could find its Ultra Wormhole and send it back. </p2> <br>

<p2> Ash attempted to participate in the Ula'ula Island challenge, but he was rejected by Nanu and lost in an impromptu "pre-trial". Afterward, Ash decided to stay on the island and train under Tapu Bulu. This allowed him to formally participate in his island challenge, which turned out to be a battle against Jessie's Mimikyu, who recently gained a Mimikium Z. 
Ash barely won thanks to Pikachu learning Electroweb, as well as being able to once again use 10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt. Finally, Ash participated in the grand trial, where he faced off against Nanu in a 3-on-1 battle in Nanu's favor and won, earning himself a Lycanium Z. <br>
Ash led the Ultra Guardians investigation into mysterious dark clouds that appeared over the Alola region, causing all of the adults in Alola to lose their energy and motivation. The cause was revealed to be a Necrozma pursuing a Lunala, which resulted in a massive battle against Necrozma. 
During this time, Nebby joined the fight; Necrozma possessed Lunala and then Nebby to become Dawn Wings and Dusk Mane Necrozma, respectively; and the Ultra Guardians pursued Necrozma into Poipole's world. 
There, they learned about how Necrozma needed to regain its true form to release Nebby. 
After Ash and Gladion acquired Z-Crystals for Nebby and Lunala, the Ultra Guardians, with the help of their Pokémon, Lunala, Poipole's friends, and everyone else in Alola, shared their Z-Power with Necrozma, causing it to release Nebby. 
Afterward, Ash and Nebby used Searing Sunraze Smash, while Gladion and Lunala used Menacing Moonraze Maelstrom on Necrozma. 
The combined Z-Moves fully restored Necrozma's light, giving it the strength to become its true form, Ultra Necrozma. 
Afterward, the Ultra Guardians, Nebby, and Lunala traveled back to Alola through the Ultra Wormhole, while Ash said farewell to Poipole, who chose to stay behind in its world. </p2> <br>

<p2> Later, Ash and his classmates arrived on Poni Island for their research projects for school. Ash's project was to have a grand trial battle. 
In A Grand Debut!, Ash battled the newly-appointed Island Kahuna Hapu in a one-on-one battle and won. Letting Pikachu choose their reward for the completion, Ash received a Steelium Z.
Following this victory, Ash entered the first-ever Manalo Conference, along with his classmates. 
He eventually made it to the semifinals, where he faced off against the Team Skull Boss Guzma. After a tough match, Ash was able to defeat him and advance to the finals, where he was set to face Gladion. <br>
On the night before the final battle, Ash's Meltan fused with its fellow Meltan, evolving into Melmetal, which Ash ended up using as his first Pokémon in the finals. 
The match eventually resulted in a battle between the two Trainers' Lycanroc, with Ash's Lycanroc eventually emerging victorious, thus earning Ash the title of Alola League Champion.
After winning the Alola League championship, Ash was given the right to have an exhibition match against the Masked Royal. 
However, during a Guzzlord invasion of the Manalo Stadium, the Masked Royal's true identity as Professor Kukui was exposed. 
With his cover blown, Kukui decided to battle Ash as himself and make the exhibition match a Full Battle, which Ash agreed to. 
During the battle, Ash's Torracat was finally able to defeat its longtime rival, Professor Kukui's Incineroar, and evolve into an Incineroar itself. 
Before Kukui could send out his last Pokémon, Tapu Koko appeared and took its place in the battle. 
When Ash was down to his last Pokémon, Pikachu, Tapu Koko gave Kukui a Tapunium Z, while Ash's Electrium Z once again transformed into a Pikashunium Z, allowing both Pokémon to unleash their signature Z-Moves. 
In the end, Ash's Pikachu's Z-Move proved superior and defeated Tapu Koko, ending the exhibition match in Ash's victory. </p2> <br>

<p2> After the Manalo Conference had ended, Ash was left unsure of what to do next. However, after hearing Olivia mention how important knowing the "outside world" is, he decided to return home and start traveling around the world. 
After saying farewell to his classmates, Kukui, and Burnet, he boarded a plane back to Kanto, leaving all of his current party Pokémon (excluding Pikachu) under the two Professors' care. </p2>
