<h2 class="head2">Johto Region (Generation 2)</h2>
<article>
<p2> Excited at the prospect of meeting new Pokémon and facing Gary again, Ash and friends left for the Johto region and traveled there to find and catch new Pokémon unseen in Kanto. 
they met on the way Kurt, to whom Ash delivered the GS Ball.
He battled the Gym Leaders there and caught the three Starter Pokémon, just as he'd done in Kanto. 
Brock returned and left Professor Ivy (for unknown reasons) and Tracey remained at Professor Oak's Lab in Pallet Town. 
During this season, Ash won two badges for the Johto League, by facing Falkner of the Violet City Gym and Bugsy of the Azalea Town Gym. 
He also catches a Shiny Noctowl, had another battle with Misty and said goodbye to his Charizard as he left it at the Charicific Valley so it could become stronger. </p2><br>

<p2> In The Grass Route, Ash competed in the Grass Tournament with Bulbasaur. He lost in the final round to Ephraim's Skiploom.
Ash won three more badges, but was delayed from having his sixth Gym Battle as the Gym Leader, Olivine Town's Jasmine, was preoccupied with caring for an ill Electric Pokémon, Ampharos, that fueled the lighthouse's power. 
Determined to get his Gym Battle, Ash traveled over to Cianwood City to get the medicine needed for Ampharos. 
Along the way he meets the Gym Leaders Whitney, Morty, Jasmine and Chuck, along with some new friends like Sakura, an aspiring Trainer and one of the 5 Kimono Sisters and reunites with Casey, whose Chikorita evolved into Bayleef. 
After his Gym Battle with Chuck, Ash and his mates traveled to the Whirl Islands on Chuck's suggestion to take part in the Whirl Cup Competition, a tournament for Water-type Pokémon.
So, Ash, along with Misty, competed in the Whirl Cup in the Whirl Islands, with Ash placing in the Top 16. He was defeated by Misty in a 3-on-3; Misty ended up losing in the next round. </p2> <br>

<p2>Ash, along with Ritchie, then helped save Silver, a child Lugia, and its parent, from the evil machinations of Team Rocket. 
During this season, Ash finally collected the remaining three badges to enter the Johto League by beating Jasmine, Pryce and Clair. 
Ash encountered Gary occasionally in Johto, and, while they were still rivals, Gary seemed to view Ash with slightly more respect than before. Ash's growth of character was evident throughout this story arc as he continued to think more and more about his Pokémon and less and less about himself. 
He also met Lance and stopped Team Rocket's latest scheme at the Lake of Rage and brought a Larvitar back to its mother. </p2> <br>

<p2> In the Johto League, Finally, the two rivals battled in the tournament in a Full Battle. 
Although it was a close battle, Ash emerged victorious against his rival for the first time in his career as a Pokémon Trainer, marking one of the biggest turning points in said career. 
After the battle, Gary and Ash departed on good terms with each other, finally overcoming their boyhood animosity and recognizing each other as equals. 
Then Ash fought Harrison from the Hoenn region, who had a Blaziken, a Fire-type Pokémon Ash had never seen before. 
To face it, Ash chose his trusty Charizard: the two Fire-types fought fiercely, but ultimately Charizard fainted and Ash lost. (However, Charizard managed to wound Blaziken badly enough to prevent Harrison from using it in his next match, which led to his defeat.) 
Ash then decided to travel to the Hoenn region, but sadly, both of his friends had to return home and thus would not be traveling with him this time. </p2> <br>
