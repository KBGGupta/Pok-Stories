<h2 class="head2">Kalos Region (Generation 6)</h2>
<article>
<p2> In Pokémon the Series: XY, Ash arrived at the Kalos region with Alexa, first visiting Lumiose City,

</figure>
where he parted ways with the journalist and tried to challenge the Lumiose Gym at Prism Tower. 
He was forcibly ejected from the tower when the computerized security system, later revealed to be the Clembot, found out that he didn't have any Kalos Badges. He was rescued by Clemont and Bonnie.
Ash brought an injured Froakie to Professor Sycamore, who told Ash about an additional stage of Pokémon evolution he was researching called Mega Evolution. Assisted by Pikachu and Froakie, Ash calmed down an angry Garchomp belonging to Sycamore that was attacking Lumiose City. 
Ash saw a Mega Evolved Pokémon for the first time when a Mega Blaziken saved him and Pikachu from falling off of Prism Tower. Froakie then allowed itself to be captured by Ash, and Clemont and Bonnie started to travel with Ash. </p2> <br>

<p2>Ash won his first Kalos Badge, the Bug Badge, after defeating the Santalune Gym Leader, Viola. The group was joined by Serena, who still remembered Ash rescuing her in her childhood and decided to start her journey to reunite with him, although he initially did not remember the two of them meeting. 
Ash and Serena learn that Clemont was the Lumiose Gym Leader, who was exiled from his Gym by his own invention. They help Clemont face Clembot, and after the issue was resolved, the two boys promised to battle after Ash fulfilled the original conditions set by Clembot (even if it was no longer necessary), to earn four Badges. 
With that, the group set off on their journey again. </p2> <br>
<figure>

</figure>
<p2>During their travels, they occasionally met the ninja boy Sanpei, whose presence always led to progress in Froakie's (and later Frogadier's and Greninja's) strength.
Ash briefly traveled with the Shalour Gym Leader Korrina to discover more about Mega Evolution and Mega Stones.
Ash and his friends later attended Professor Sycamore's Pokémon Summer Camp, where they met the trio of Shauna, Tierno, and Trevor, with whom the group started a friendly rivalry with. In Ash's case, his rivalry would mainly be with Trevor and Tierno as Serena and Shauna pursued Pokémon Showcases. </p2> <br>

<p2>During their journey, Ash caught a lost and traumatized Goomy, which he raised into a Sliggoo, and later, a powerful Goodra. 
After earning his fourth Gym Badge, Ash eventually faced Clemont in their promised Gym Battle, and won with Goodra's help, gaining his fifth Badge. 
Later, Ash and friends came across Goodra's old home, where they discovered it was taken over by a Florges and her companions. After saving Goodra's swamp from Team Rocket while simultaneously solving the issue concerning Florges, Ash left Goodra in the wetlands so it could act as the protector of its swamp and the Pokémon living in it. </p2> <br>

<p2>Some time afterward, when Ash reached Laverre City to challenge the Gym, he made a new rival in Sawyer, a novice trainer hailing from Hoenn. 
Along the way, Ash would also support Serena in her quest to become Kalos Queen and gave her some helpful advice when she eventually lost, telling her that losing is simply another step towards victory. <br>
Later in their journeys, Ash and friends reached Anistar City and, together with Professor Sycamore, they met the Gym Leader, Olympia. 
She revealed his Frogadier's past as a Froakie from before meeting Ash and a glimpse of Frogadier's, his friend's, Sycamore's, Team Rocket's, and his fate, indicating that they would all play a vital role in Kalos's future. <br>
Ash challenged her to a Double Battle, which he won using Frogadier and Talonflame.
Shortly after, the group came across a mysterious Pokémon, dubbed Squishy by Bonnie, who was being pursued relentlessly by the villainous team Team Flare, prompting the group to put it under their protective custody. 
Some time afterward, Ash and his friends got involved in a conflict in Sanpei's hometown, which led to Frogadier evolving into Greninja, as well as achieving Bond Phenomenon for the first time. During another confrontation with Team Flare in Terminus Cave, Ash learned Bond Phenomenon came at a cost, as he was able to share Greninja's senses, but also share its pain. <br>
Later on, Ash met up with Alain, who became intrigued by Greninja's Bond Phenomenon and requested to battle Ash. 
Ash put up a decent fight but eventually lost. After his loss against Alain, Ash and Greninja began training to perfect Greninja's new form. 
Ash and Greninja later had a rematch with Alain and a battle against Diantha, during the latter Greninja even managed to reach its final Ash-Greninja form. 
Despite their training, the two were unsuccessful to master the transformation as Ash passed out during both battles from exhaustion from using the form.
After losing a rematch with Sawyer, in which Greninja even failed to transform, Ash began feeling doubtful of his ability to master the transformation. 
His confidence was shaken further after brutally losing to Wulfric, the Snowbelle Gym Leader. 
After seeing how badly Greninja got hurt during their battle and blaming himself for the loss, a depressed Ash left into the Winding Woods by himself. After an argument with Serena, Ash was able to get back to his old self. <br>
He later met up with Greninja, and while trying to save a wild Spewpa, the two were able to perfect Bond Phenomenon. With Greninja's Ash-Greninja form perfected, Ash was able to defeat Wulfric in a rematch, earning him his final Kalos Gym Badge and qualifying him for participation in the Lumiose Conference. <br>
After returning to Lumiose City, Ash entered the Lumiose Conference. Following several notable victories, Ash had Goodra rejoin his team for his semi-final battle against Sawyer. 
After a narrow victory in, Ash managed to defeat Sawyer and reach the finals of the Conference, marking his first appearance in the finals of a Pokémon League; where he would face Alain. 
On the night before the final battle, he and his friends learned more about the Ash-Greninja transformation. 
In the finals of the Lumiose Conference, Ash and Alain started a back and forth battle that eventually came down to Alain's Mega Charizard X against Ash's Greninja in its Ash-Greninja form. </p2> <br>

<p2>After a fierce battle, Greninja was defeated, causing Ash to end up as the Runner-Up of the Lumiose Conference. 
Ash showed great sincerity and principle following the battle, shaking Alain's hand regardless of the result. <br>
Then Ash and his Pokémon captured by Team Flare
During the closing ceremony of the conference, Team Flare began their final operation, using the power of the blue Zygarde Core Z2 to cause massive roots to destroy parts of Lumiose City. 
Ash and his Pokémon were ultimately abducted by Team Flare and were taken captive at the top of Prism Tower, as Lysandre intended to use Ash and Greninja's Bond Phenomenon for his plans by using Team Flare's Mega Evolution energy ray to control them. 
However, upon hearing Pikachu's voice, Ash resisted the machine's influence, even getting Greninja to do the same thing. After talking some sense into Alain, Ash and Greninja broke free from their bindings by using Bond Phenomenon. 
Ash and Alain soon engaged in a battle against Lysandre, and ultimately managed to defeat him. When Ash later heard about the Giant Rock, he met up with the rest to combat it. 
Thanks to everyone's combined effort, Chespie was saved from the Giant Rock. </p2>

<p2> Squishy and Z2 ultimately destroyed the creature, before the two Zygarde left. </p2> <br>
<figure>

</figure>
<p2>Following the crisis, Ash helped Alain and Serena resolve their issues and bade farewell to his rivals. 
Later, after dropping Goodra off at the wetlands again, the group came across Xerosic, one of Team Flare's Scientists. Ash, his Greninja, and his friends and the gang were ultimately able to foil Xerosic's plans and hand him over to Officer Jenny. 
The group soon reunited with Squishy and Z2, who requested Greninja's help to obliterate the remaining negative energy left by Team Flare's crisis. <br>
Knowing this was for the sake of Kalos, Ash bade farewell to Greninja before Greninja left with the two Zygarde. 
After releasing Greninja, Ash and the gang headed back to Lumiose City to say their final goodbyes. <br>
After bidding farewell to Serena, who headed for Hoenn, Ash separated from Clemont and Bonnie as well and returned to Pallet Town. </p2>
